# Sentiment-Analyzer

## Overview
The Sentiment Analysis Model is a machine learning project that uses TensorFlow to predict the sentiment of text data. The model is initially trained on Twitter tweets data from Kaggle and can be fine-tuned by users with other sentiment data to make predictions according to their preferences. This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) file with the complete code for preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Features
- **Sentiment Prediction:** Predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text data.
- **TensorFlow Implementation:** Uses TensorFlow for building and training the model.
- **Fine-Tuning Capability:** Users can fine-tune the model with other sentiment data to customize predictions.
- **Reference Notebook:** Includes a Jupyter Notebook with all the necessary code for preprocessing, training, and prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for model development.
- **TensorFlow:** Machine learning framework used for building and training the sentiment analysis model.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive notebook used for code development and demonstration.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sentiment-Analyzer.git
    cd Sentiment-Analyzer
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data and train the model.
3. Fine-tune the model with your dataset by replacing the Twitter tweets data with other sentiment data.
4. Use the trained model to make sentiment predictions.
